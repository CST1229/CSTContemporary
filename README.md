# CST Stone Simulator

A small web game I made. Consider this a sort of "break" from larger projects. I mostly made this on my mostly-used-for-writing-during-class laptop during school, aside from some later development which I did on my main PC at home.

This was also originally intended to run as a HTA, which is why it uses only stuff in IE11.
