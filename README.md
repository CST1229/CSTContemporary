# CST Contemporary

CST's random engine testing playground based on CST Stone Simulator, with a random name, that I mostly work on with my mostly-used-for-writing laptop during school.

## Development

Unlike Stone Simulator, this fetches non-image files so CORS is required (if you have node.js installed with the http-server package globally also installed, you can use the included server.bat file).
